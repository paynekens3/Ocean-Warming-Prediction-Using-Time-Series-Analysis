# Ocean Temperature Forecasting

# This project aims to forecast ocean temperatures using historical temperature data. We use two forecasting models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

# Dependencies
R: Version 3.5 or higher

# Required Libraries:
tidyverse (for data manipulation and visualization)
lubridate (for date handling)
zoo (for interpolation of missing values)
forecast (for ARIMA model)
keras and tensorflow (for LSTM model)
Python: Required for Keras and TensorFlow.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocean-temperature-forecasting.git
